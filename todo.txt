For implementation 
1. dynamic lambda for arriving 

2. No menu, Customer always take either coffee or expresso, but not always hot food. Maybe need to add prob for ordering multiple coffee and food?
    a. It is Use mean revenue instead of actual food profit and waste. change it? ------ 
    b. profit and food/beverage waste

3. Need to record customer queue time, currently I am recording customer system time. Brew time.

4. Need add a warm up period before recording.

5. play around with config..
    • Staff allocation per shift (e.g., number of cashiers, cooks, baristas, and bussers)
    • Beverage policy (e.g., urn size and brew schedule)
    • Prioritization at the pack station (e.g., whether mobile or drive-thru orders get precedence)
    • Pickup shelf capacity
    • Number of toasters or espresso machines

6. Dynamic labour cost?

7. wait time avg is unreasonably high, maybe there are some logic error..

8. maybe stop take customer until certain time.

9. For now I am adding mobile throughput even when they renege. But why renege count is more than throughput....?  

10. readme update

Bug free:

Possible simulation bugs, suggested by results such as:
1. different methods producing nearly identical performance when they clearly should differ;
2. performance remaining unchanged under significantly different parameter settings;
3. unusually large confidence intervals;
4. results that are difficult to interpret or show no clear performance trends.

- for report 

1. CRN method comparing scenarios

2. Calcualte confidence intervals in the performance evaluation 

3. explain the main flow 

4. following the “Guideline for Writing Report,”

5. Writing issue - unpolished chatgpt in writing. grammatical errors...
